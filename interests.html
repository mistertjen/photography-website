			<p>My greatests interest is to keep learning and develop myself. Life for me is all about seeing the world and mastering something new. This page has some stories of the hobbies I've spend my time on. </p>

				<h2>Games</h2>
				<p> Like most kids I played a lot of games when I was young. I took a particular interest in mental games, both board games and video games. I've spend many hours strategizing together with friends. Games are a great way for me to experience new fictional worlds with their societal systems. Some games that I've played a lot throughout my years: Runescape, Super Smash Bros., Guild Wars, Dota. </p>
				<p> Nowadays I am retired from of all those. Dota was the most recent one with close to 1700 hours on record (across several years), which funny enough counts as a young player on the level I was playing. Recently I am learning the classical game of chess together with some friends. As well as playing a varianty of games with interesting concepts, for example Factorio. A game about building automated construction systems to harvest resources to then build.... larger automated construction systems. The mental process of constructing highly scalable architecture is great training, I'd recommend it to anyone and especially developers. </p>

				<h2>Photography</h2>
				<p> Although I am just a beginner, photography has grabbed my interest as a new medium to experience the world. I currently use a Nikon D3300 with the kitlens. I think this is currently sufficient to learn with. My goal is to capture interesting scenes seeing reality in a creative way. I actually started with photography to improve my feeling for aesthetics when building websites. In a sense every website is like a photograph. The importance of contrast, focus and balance are all similarities between the two worlds. More of my collection can be found on the <a href="photos.html"> photo page</a>.</p>

				<h2>Anime</h2>
				<p> Aaaah anime, it definitely deserves a mention as part of my hobbies. I generally like anime more than western shows. Anime is usually the playground for much more creative, over-the-top storylines since the animated style has less limitations than western movies/series. Part of this is also due to the lovely and crazy Japanese culture from which it originates. Many plots I've watch are somewhat superpower themed such as Naruto, Death Note and Code Geass. My favorite running show is Shokugeki No Soma Season 2! An amazing show about a top culinairy school, like Masterchef but better. Don't mind the overly sexualized first few episodes, it gets less and better.  </p>
